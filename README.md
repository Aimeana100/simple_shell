## Shell Project
We had built a simple program implementing unix shell in C language as ALX student .
Our shell will have the same output as /bin/sh. 

## Work objective
We are building our simple shell to deepen our understanding of how the shell reads,
interprets, and executes commands given by a user. 

## Testing
To test, after cloning this repository, use the following to compile the program.
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

When you run ./hsh you will see a prompt represented by the dollar sign '$' ready
for your command. 
Or for non-interactive mode, after compiling, you can use the following to list
the items in the directory (for example).
echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
